Please extend the Account class located in Bank by adding the history of transactions.
Entries should be added to the history everytime the "deposit", "charge" or "calc_interest" methods are called and
should contain the operation type (same as method name), the parameter value (amount), the balance after the operation
and date and time automatically taken from the operating system.
You may implement it as just a list of string entries, however, a preferred way would be to create a separate class as
a template for each Operation entry.
